        In this version of blackjack, 
        the goal is to have a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer without going over. 
        Number cards count as their face value, face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10, 
        and an Ace can be worth either 1 or 11, whichever is more helpful. 
        Each player is dealt two cards face up, while the dealer receives one card face up and one face down. 
        On their turn, a player can either “hit” to take another card or “stand” to keep their total as is. 
        Players may continue hitting until they either choose to stand or go over 21, 
        which is called a bust and results in an automatic loss. After all players finish, 
        the dealer reveals their hidden card and must draw cards until reaching at least 17, 
        at which point they must stand. If the dealer busts, all players who are still in automatically win. 
        Otherwise, each player's total is compared to the dealer's: the higher hand wins, equal hands result in a tie 
        (called a push), and lower hands lose. A hand consisting of an Ace and a 10-value card dealt immediately is called a 
        blackjack and beats all other hands.
